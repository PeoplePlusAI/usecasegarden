Welcome to the Use Case Garden! This repository serves as a collaborative space to document and explore AI use cases unique to India. We aim to provide a rich library of real-world AI applications, helping innovators, developers, and industry leaders connect, contribute, and collaborate to solve pressing challenges and unlock new opportunities.

The database of ALL use cases is being maintained here: https://pplus.ai/usecasegarden 

You can also submit an idea to the Garden here: https://pplus.ai/submit-usecase

## Project Goals

The Use Case Garden's primary goal is to activate the imagination of India‚Äôs AI makers. By cataloging use cases that are relevant and unique to the Indian ecosystem, we aim to support developers, startups, NGOs, and other stakeholders in discovering, discussing, and developing AI solutions. Our vision is to make this repository a vibrant community resource where contributors can share, learn, and build impactful AI projects.

## What we are striving towards 

- Connection & Collaboration: Facilitate connections between makers, experts, and stakeholders interested in AI applications across various sectors.
- Accessible & Actionable Knowledge: Enable easy access to actionable use cases and foster ongoing contributions from the community.
- AI for India: Support AI projects that address challenges specific to India, spanning industries like healthcare, agriculture, governance, and more.
