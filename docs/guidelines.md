# Architecting Guidelines for Use Case Garden  

Welcome to Use Case Garden! If you're here, you're likely thinking about how to build scalable, impactful, and frugally brilliant solutions for India. Before you start, here’s a practical guide to architecting solutions that align with our philosophy.

---

## **1. Keep It Practical**
Don’t get lost in the theoretical “what-ifs.” Focus on the **here and now**:  
- **Solve for actual problems.** Start with the specific problem your solution addresses. Who benefits? How?  
- **Build for real-world use.** Think beyond the repository – will your solution survive the complexities of deployment in diverse environments?  

Imagine you’re building for the busiest street in Mumbai or the most remote village in Assam – your architecture should thrive in either.  

---

## **2. +1 Thinking**  
Inspired by the idea of "Invoked Leadership" (from [Societal Thinking](https://societalthinking.org/blog/invoked-2-0-leadership-innovation-curiosity/)), +1 thinking means:  
- **Start small, think big.** Build for today with an eye on tomorrow. It’s not about “over-building”; it’s about leaving room for scale.  
- **Ask yourself, “What’s the next +1?”** If your solution works for one city, how will it work for ten? If it’s useful for one NGO, what about ten more?  

Remember, India is a diverse, complex, and rapidly evolving landscape. Your design should stay curious and flexible to keep up.

## **3. Embrace Frugality**  
When architecting for India, **frugality isn’t a limitation; it’s a superpower.** Here’s how to do it:  
- **Low-cost, high-impact tools.** Avoid over-engineering. If open-source works, use it. If a lightweight script suffices, skip the bulky framework.  
- **Test your assumptions.** Could you achieve the same result with fewer resources? Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most effective.  
- **Resource-light execution.** Think of bandwidth-limited environments, shared devices, and affordable scaling.  

---

## **4. Explain Your Choices**  
This isn’t a college project – it’s a **collaborative, transparent effort.** When you pick a library, method, or framework:  
- **Document it.** Why this library? Why not something else? What makes this choice practical, scalable, and frugal?  
- **Anticipate questions.** How does this decision reflect +1 thinking? Will it still hold up in a resource-constrained environment?  

For example:  
“Why TensorFlow over PyTorch? Because TensorFlow Lite works better on edge devices, making it ideal for rural healthcare applications where low-power devices are common.”

## **The Tone: Playful, Curious, Inclusive**  

### Picture this:  
We’re at a chai stall, debating the best algorithm for detecting potholes in Bangalore, while also wondering if we can use the same framework to map solar panel efficiency in Ladakh. Keep the tone friendly, creative, and rooted in our mission: **to make AI that works for real people in real places.**  

If it feels a little like you’re writing cringe poetry or an overly enthusiastic event invite, you’re on the right track. Because serious solutions don’t have to sound serious.  

---

### Example:  
“Why MongoDB? Because it scales faster than the Mumbai local. Why edge computing? Because bandwidth is a luxury in the hills of Himachal. Every decision has a story, and your architecture should tell it.”  

---

### TL;DR:  
Practical + +1 Thinking + Frugal = A solution India can use, today and tomorrow.  

Now go forth and build something amazing. And maybe throw in some chai breaks while you’re at it. ☕
